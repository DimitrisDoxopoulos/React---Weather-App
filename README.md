# React-Weather-App

This is a weather app project built with ReactJS.
It utilizes hooks and a clean way to write code and manage
components.

### What it does

Basically, you choose a city and it shows information about
the weather. In future updates I will add the functionality of
being able to see weather forecast for future and (possibly)
earlier dates.
