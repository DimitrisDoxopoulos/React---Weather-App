# React-Weather-App

This is a weather app project built with ReactJS.
It utilizes hooks and a clean way to write code and manage
components.

### What it does

Basically, you choose a city and it shows information about
the weather. In future updates I will add the functionality of
being able to see weather forecast for future and (possibly)
earlier dates.

This project was based on [HamScript's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBV-JvG9Ubkj7AU6Cxls1Tw)
video, titled [React Weather App with Hooks and Context | React.js Tutorial 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At_5xYramLk).
The API used for receiving the forecast is [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
